# Cell Nuclei Semantic Segmentation
This project aims to develop an algorithm for semantic segmentation that can automatically detect nuclei in images. The algorithm has the potential to expedite research in various diseases, including cancer, heart disease, and rare disorders, by enabling researchers to analyze the DNA contained within cell nuclei. This genetic information plays a crucial role in determining the function of each cell and understanding the underlying biological processes.

## Model Architecture

The segmentation model uses the U-Net architecture with:
- Pretrained MobileNetV2 as the encoder.
- Skip connections to preserve spatial information.
- Decoder with upsampling layers for resolution enhancement.
